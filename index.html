		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p> Most of this data comes from the Johns Hopkins University. But some, specifically the data for China and all that comes before January 22nd, comes from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Both the United Kingdom and France have their data coming from government databases. </P>

			<p> The elements that are used are sound with different noises indicating different thresholds. The visuals for this project are supposed to resemble flowers, ones that have ling stems that blossom into a huge flower at the top once they hit a certain amount of cases. A flower was made for many different regions, that displays data up until the first peak all the way back in March of 2020. </p>

		<p> COVID deaths through sound is one of the most heartbreaking Dataviz projects I have ever seen. It is one thing to here the sheer amount of deaths that have occurred worldwide since the start of this pandemic, it is another thing to hear them. Do any of us know what 100,000 deaths really is? How about a million? Throughout this project, we listen to the noises of bell tolls and drones & plucking that indicates, respectively, different thresholds in cases and the increase of deaths. </p>
		<p> This dataviz project is affective in that it speaks to the heart. We, as people, cannot rationalize huge numbers, but having tragic flowers bloom before our eyes plucks on our heartstrings in a way that data rarely can. Mona Chalabi would definitely support this project as it represents all that she believes data can be.

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

 <iframe title="5 Countries with the Highest Combined Number of Active Troops from 1991 to 2020." aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Q1KdO" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q1KdO/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
